## Analytics

* Piwik - Free, open source analytic alternative to Google Anal.
* Google Analytics - Also pretty much free

## Blogging

* Wordpress - If you haven't heard of it, get out from under your rock ;)
* Ghost - A beautiful blogging software written in Node, and it's magical
* Grav - A flat file blogging/CMS with good starting off points and an awesome admin interface

## Bookmarks and Lists

* Apaxy - .htaccess beautification of the default Apache file list

## Email

* Mail In A Box - All in one mail solution, use it for most of my domains
* GSuite (formerly google apps for business) - Easy integration with Gmail, terrible for sending email to other people

## Forums

* Discourse - Modern forums written in Rails, shipped in a Docker container to keep things tidy. Don't use it for anything recently because of emailing issues
* IPB (Invision Power Board) - Only 1 license, used for Auren Gaming.
* Xenforo - Used for the TownyKingdoms website, and my favorite of anything
* Woltlab Burning Board - Mostly just for testing

## File Sharing

* Nextcloud - Highly extendable piece of kit that's only used for lists and such
* Pydio - A really cool piece of software that I use for personal file hosting

## Media Streaming

* Plex - Because why would I use anything else

## Monitoring

* Cachet - Set up to feed from a bot that's broken, mostly for me to report issues to people

## Office

* Microsoft Suite - Most popular tool for windows
* Libre Office - What I use on Linux

## Passwords

* LastPass - Is it the most secure? No. But I like it better than anything that comes with browsers.

## Software Development

* Atom - Atom editor from Github
* Brackets - A good alternative to Atom with more features (imo) out of the box
* Eclipse - My secondary for Java
* FileZilla - Not neccessarily a dev tool, just what I use for FTP
* IntelliJ - Main IDE for Java (community version)
* Notepad++ - Lightweight YAML editor (that's what I use it for at least)
* Prepros - Preprocess and minify SCSS, LESS, and Javascript

## URL Shortening

* Polr - A lightweight PHP link shortener with Bootstrap styles

## VPN

* TunnelBear - The best VPN I've ever run

## Web Servers

* Apache (LAMdbP Stack) - Apache running alongside PHP 7 & Maria DB
* NGINX (LEMdbP Stack) - Nginx running alongside PHP 7 FPM & Maria DB

## Wikis

* Media Wiki - The most popular wiki software, used by Wikipedia and other huge names
* Grav - Using their RTFM skeleton w/ the admin panel extension
* MkDocs - Self-hosted self-compile "read the docs"-ish Python Markdown compiler
* Sphinx - Similar to MkDocs, only using reStructured Text Markup ~~instead~~ along side of Markdown
